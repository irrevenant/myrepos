   * Deal with abs\_path change in new version of perl, now it returns undefined
     when the directory does not exist.
   * Added --minimal mode. Closes: #[694031](http://bugs.debian.org/694031) Thanks, Paul Wise.
   * Use libio-pty-easy-perl when available when captuting command output
     (for --minimal or -jN), so that programs that output color to terminals
     will be colorized. This is only a recommends as it will fall back to
     the old method. Thanks, Paul Wise."""]]
